# Tic Tac Toe (MVC + OOP)

A simple implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game using **Python**, structured with the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## ðŸ§  Project Structure

This project is designed to clearly separate concerns using the MVC pattern:

- **Model**: Handles the game logic, board state, and win/draw detection.
- **View**: Manages the user interface and output (console-based in this version).
- **Controller**: Coordinates input from the player and updates both model and view accordingly.


## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, run:

```bash
python main.py
